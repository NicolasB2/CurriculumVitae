During the development of the workshop I encountered various difficulties, the most constant was organizing the dimensions of the components so that it looked good and remained responsive, another recurring problem was the ignorance of the components and how to edit their characteristics mainly due to the lack of knowledge of the Bootstrap tool and my lack of expertise in html and css, another problem that appeared during development was the organization and division of the page in a way that was more visually pleasing.<br>

In conclusion, Bootstrap is a very useful tool when developing responsive pages, it is easy to understand and implement, it has a great variety of very interesting components that make development faster.<br>
